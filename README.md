## 📌 What is Phishing?

Phishing is when someone sends a fake email that looks like it’s from a trusted company like a bank, Amazon, or even your workplace. The goal is usually to trick you into clicking a link to a fake website (a replica) so they can steal your personal information like login credentials, bank info, or ID numbers.

These attacks often look real and urgent they might say your account is locked, or there's a suspicious purchase.

## 🚨 Why Phishing Works

- **People trust brand names**  
- **Emails often use fear or urgency**  
- **Links and fake websites can look almost identical**  
- **Most users don’t double-check URLs or sender details**

## 🛡️ How to Spot a Phishing Email

✅ Email address is poorly written (typos, off grammar)  
✅ Sender address doesn’t match the company domain  
✅ Hovering over links shows a weird or misspelled URL  
✅ Message pressures you to “act now” or threatens account lockouts  
✅ Unexpected attachments or requests for personal info

## 🔐 How to Stay Safe

- Don’t click links in emails you weren’t expecting  
- Always double-check the sender email address  
- Use multi-factor authentication  
- Report suspicious emails to IT/security team  
- If unsure, visit the website directly (don’t click)
